# Citibike bike sharing

## Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to determine the feasibility of applying the Citibike bikesharing model that is used in New York City to Des Moines, Iowa.
## Results
  The Tableau Data visualization story can be found at this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jason.dibble/viz/JWD-Citibike-Challenge/CitibikeNYClientele]. 
  The first and second graph shows that the vast majority of trips are less than an hour long with the most common duration being only 5 minutes, and that males are the most common gender.

  The third and fourth graphs are heatmaps that show that the most common time of day for stoptime is split between the morning and evening, and this is similar for both men and women.

  The fifth page shows that the majority of citibike users are subscribers. This suggests that the users are not using Citibike on a whim, but use of the bike is a part of their daily plan.

  Finally, the mapping of the dropoff points shows that there is more Citibike activity on Manhattan than the surrounding areas.

## Summary
  Ultimately, this data suggests that the most common clientele are men that have a short commute to work. 
  There are two factors that could use additional investigation before commiting to this venture:
  1. What are the parking options in Des Moines? If parking is not available or if it is expensive those individuals may be looking for alternatives. Explore a map with available free and paid parking.
  2. What is the average commute in Des Moines? There is likely a good way to estimate how many workers in the downtown Des Moines area work there and would benefit from having bikes available rather than needing to rely on a car.
